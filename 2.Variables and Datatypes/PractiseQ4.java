/*What will be the types of result in the following in Java Code 
        byte b = 4 ;
        char c = 'a';
        short s = 512;
        int i =  1000;
        float f = 3.14f;
        double d = 99.954;

        result =  (f*b)+ ( i%c) - (d*s);
        (Hint : Look at the largest data types among these)

        Ans. Result is double type because of "Type conversion".
